# PhysicsEngine

Partially-written physics engine that uses OpenGL for the graphical backend. This project exists so that I could have code to include on my resume, though it doesn't work properly. I wanted to have the code finished, but unfortunatly school and work have been absorbing the majority of my time recently.

Libraries included are GLEW, GLFW, IMGUI, & FreeType.
